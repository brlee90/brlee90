- 👋 Hi, I’m @brlee90. I currently work as a controls engineer - programming PLCs, HMIs, and custom applications as well as setting up automated data storage using VBA and Python. I also deal a little bit with IT/networking.
- 👀 I’m interested in open source and browser-based applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python plus a little bit of everything else as it comes up.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything! I like learning and creating useful programs. I use open source software quite a bit (Ubuntu, Libreoffice, FreeCAD, etc.) and would love to be able to contribute one day.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
